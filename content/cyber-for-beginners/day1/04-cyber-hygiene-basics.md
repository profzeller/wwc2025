# Cyber Hygiene Basics

Cyber hygiene refers to routine practices that reduce cybersecurity risk.

## Core Practices

### Authentication
- Strong passphrases
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)

### Least Privilege
- Users should have only the access they need

### Patching and Updates
- Known vulnerabilities are commonly exploited
- Regular updates reduce exposure

### Backups
- Protect availability and integrity
- Backups must be tested, not just created

### User Awareness
- Recognizing suspicious emails
- Safe browsing habits

## Why Hygiene Matters
Most successful attacks exploit basic hygiene failures,
not advanced zero-day vulnerabilities.

## Teaching Tip
Cyber hygiene activities are easy to embed into existing labs
and require minimal new infrastructure.
