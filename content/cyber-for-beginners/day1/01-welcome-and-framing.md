# Welcome & Framing Cybersecurity

## Why This Workshop Exists

Cybersecurity is no longer confined to specialized security teams.
It appears in networking, systems administration, cloud computing,
software development, and IT support.

Many instructors are already teaching cybersecurity concepts —
they just are not labeling them as such.

This workshop is designed to:

  - Build a shared cybersecurity vocabulary
  - Increase instructor confidence
  - Translate cybersecurity concepts into teachable material

## What This Workshop Is Not

  - Not a penetration testing bootcamp
  - Not certification training
  - Not tool-specific deep dives

Instead, this workshop focuses on **concepts, judgment, and pedagogy**.

## Discussion Prompt

  - What courses do you currently teach?
  - Where does cybersecurity already appear in those courses?
  - What concerns do you have about teaching cybersecurity topics?
