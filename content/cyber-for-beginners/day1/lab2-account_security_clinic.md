![Students identifying cyber hygiene problems in a scenario](images/day1-lab2-hygiene-challenge.png)

## Goal
Explore how real people protect accounts in practice, and learn how small decisions about passwords, MFA, and recovery can prevent major security incidents.

This lab focuses on **realistic choices**, not trick questions.

## What You’ll Do

You will use a **web-based Account Security Clinic** to work through short modules about common account security problems.

Work in **pairs or small groups**.

Estimated time: **15 minutes**

## Available Modules

### Passwords & Passphrases
- Generate strong passphrases
- Compare what actually makes passwords safer
- Discuss common bad habits and why they happen

---

### MFA Push Fatigue
- Simulate repeated MFA prompts
- See what happens when users approve, deny, or report them
- Learn the safest response to unexpected prompts

---

### Account Recovery
- Review example recovery codes
- Discuss what happens when a phone or device is lost
- Identify common recovery failures

---

### Phishing-Resistant Authentication
- Compare SMS, authenticator apps, push prompts, and passkeys
- Learn which methods resist phishing and why

---

## Reflection

After completing your modules, be ready to discuss:

- Which practices could students realistically do on their own?
- Which require school or organization support?
- What is one change that would meaningfully improve security?

## Getting Started
