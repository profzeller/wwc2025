# Web Basics (HTTP/S) for Cyber

## What happens when you visit a website

1. Your device resolves a name (DNS)
2. Your browser connects to a server
3. The browser requests a page (HTTP)
4. The server responds with content

## HTTP vs HTTPS

- **HTTP**: sends data in plain text (not safe on untrusted networks)
- **HTTPS**: encrypts data in transit and validates the server’s identity (certificate)

## Cookies and sessions

- A **cookie** is small data stored by your browser
- A **session** is how a site remembers you are logged in

If someone steals your session cookie, they may not need your password.

## Practice (5 minutes)
Write one reason HTTPS matters:

- For confidentiality:
- For integrity:
- For identity:
