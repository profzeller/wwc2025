# Web Basics (HTTP/S) for Cyber

## Learning objectives
- Explain HTTP request/response
- Describe HTTPS as encryption + identity (certificate validation)
- Define cookies and sessions at a beginner level

## HTTP (plain language)
A browser (client) requests a resource from a server.
The server responds with content and a status code.

## HTTPS mental model
HTTPS provides:
- **Confidentiality** (encryption in transit)
- **Integrity** (tamper resistance in transit)
- **Identity** (certificate validation)

## Cookies and sessions
- Cookies store small pieces of state
- Sessions represent “you are logged in”
- Stolen session cookies can be as damaging as stolen passwords

## Teaching activity (10 minutes)
Ask: “What must be true for a login to be reasonably secure?”
Capture answers and map them back to CIA + risk.
