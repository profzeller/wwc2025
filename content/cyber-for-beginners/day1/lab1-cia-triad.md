# Lab 1 — CIA Triad in Action

## Objective
Apply the CIA Triad to real-world scenarios and justify your reasoning.

## Instructions
Work in small groups. For each scenario:
1. Identify the **primary** CIA component impacted
2. Identify any **secondary** impacts
3. Propose one reasonable control that could reduce risk

## Scenarios

1. A teacher’s laptop containing unencrypted student grades is stolen.
2. A ransomware attack encrypts a department file server for four days.
3. A shared lab manual is altered to include incorrect commands.
4. Campus Wi-Fi fails during an online exam window.
5. An HR spreadsheet containing sensitive data is emailed to the wrong group.

## Discussion Questions
- Why might multiple CIA components apply?
- Which incidents cause the most operational impact?
- What evidence would indicate each incident occurred?

## Teaching Adaptation
This lab can be simplified for introductory courses
or expanded with log analysis and incident detection.
