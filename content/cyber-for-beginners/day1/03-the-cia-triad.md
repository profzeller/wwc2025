The CIA Triad defines the core goals of cybersecurity.

## Confidentiality
Preventing unauthorized access to information.
Examples:

- Encryption
- Authentication
- Access controls

## Integrity
Preventing unauthorized or undetected modification of information.
Examples:

- Hashing
- Version control
- Change management

## Availability
Ensuring systems and data are accessible when needed.
Examples:

- Backups
- Redundancy
- Fault tolerance

## Important Notes

- Most real-world incidents impact **more than one** CIA component
- Security often involves **trade-offs** between CIA goals
- The CIA Triad is a *thinking tool*, not a checklist

## Teaching Tip

Use the CIA Triad to help students reason about incidents
instead of reacting emotionally to breaches.
