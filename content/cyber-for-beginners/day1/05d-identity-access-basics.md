# Identity & Access Basics

## Learning objectives
- Distinguish authentication vs authorization
- Explain least privilege using real roles and systems
- Teach strong authentication without creating high friction

## Definitions
- **Authentication**: who are you?
- **Authorization**: what can you do?

## Least privilege
Give people the minimum access needed to do the job.

## Passwords and reality
- Password reuse is common
- Phishing bypasses “strong password” rules
- Password managers reduce risk and improve usability

## MFA
MFA reduces the impact of stolen passwords.
It does not eliminate phishing risk entirely.

## Exercise (15 minutes)
Pick a realistic environment:
- Define 5 roles (student worker, instructor, lab admin, IT staff, etc.)
- Identify the minimum access each role needs
- Identify one access that is commonly over-granted
