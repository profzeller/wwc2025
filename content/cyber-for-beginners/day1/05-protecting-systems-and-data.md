# Protecting Systems and Data

Cybersecurity relies on **layered defense**.

## Endpoint Protection
- Antivirus / EDR
- Host firewalls
- Disk encryption

## Network Protection
- Firewalls
- Network segmentation
- VPNs

## Identity and Access
- Authentication
- Authorization
- Identity management

## Data Protection
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Backups and recovery planning

## Activity
Map one tool you already use to each protection layer.

## Teaching Tip
Reframe existing IT labs as cybersecurity labs
by emphasizing *why* protections exist.
