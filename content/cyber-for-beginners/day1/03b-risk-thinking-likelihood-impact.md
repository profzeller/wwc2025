# Risk Thinking (Likelihood × Impact)

## Learning objectives
By the end of this section, participants will be able to:

- Explain risk as a decision model (not a feeling)
- Use a simple risk rubric (likelihood × impact) to prioritize controls
- Teach beginners to reason about trade-offs

## Core model
**Risk = Likelihood × Impact**

- Likelihood: how probable is the event?
- Impact: if it happens, how bad is it?

## Practical examples (use your environment)
Pick a familiar environment (school lab, small business, campus IT).

### Scenario A
A shared admin password exists on multiple systems.

- Likelihood:
- Impact:
- One control to reduce likelihood:
- One control to reduce impact:

### Scenario B
Backups exist, but restore has never been tested.

- Likelihood:
- Impact:
- One control to reduce likelihood:
- One control to reduce impact:

## Teaching tip
Beginners learn faster when you keep the discussion anchored to:

- “What are we protecting?”
- “What could go wrong?”
- “What’s the simplest control that moves the needle?”
