# Risk Thinking (Likelihood × Impact)

## Big idea
Security work is about **risk decisions**. You cannot fix everything at once, so you choose what matters most.

## Simple model
**Risk = Likelihood × Impact**

- Likelihood: How probable is it?
- Impact: If it happens, how bad is it?

## Why this helps
Two problems can feel scary, but one might be far more likely—or far more damaging.

## Practice (10 minutes)
Rate each scenario using:

- Likelihood: Low / Medium / High
- Impact: Low / Medium / High

Then decide which you would handle first.

1. Backups exist, but nobody has tested restoring them.
2. Staff reuse passwords across multiple accounts.
3. A public website is missing updates and patches.

Write:

- Scenario with highest priority:
- One control that reduces likelihood:
- One control that reduces impact:
