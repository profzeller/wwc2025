# Threats, Vulnerabilities, Controls

## Learning objectives
- Differentiate **threat**, **vulnerability**, and **control**
- Categorize controls: administrative, technical, physical
- Identify “high-leverage” beginner controls

## Definitions
- **Threat**: something capable of causing harm (person, group, event)
- **Vulnerability**: a weakness that can be exploited
- **Control**: a safeguard that reduces likelihood and/or impact

## Control categories
- **Administrative**: policies, training, procedures, standards
- **Technical**: MFA, patching, segmentation, EDR, logging
- **Physical**: locks, badges, secured storage, cameras

## Activity (15–20 minutes)
Choose one system you support or teach.

1. List 3 assets.
2. List 3 threats.
3. List 3 vulnerabilities.
4. Propose 3 controls (at least one admin + one technical).

## Instructor note
This page is designed to help instructors teach cybersecurity without “tool worship.”
Keep the emphasis on reasoning and decision-making.
