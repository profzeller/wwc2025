# Logging & Detection Basics

## Learning objectives
- Explain what logs are and why they matter
- Identify “high value” logs for beginner environments
- Introduce detection as “signal finding,” not perfection

## What is a log?
A record of an event. Logs support:
- Incident response
- Troubleshooting
- Accountability (who did what, when)

## High-value logs (starter list)
- Authentication (logins, failures, MFA events)
- Endpoint security alerts (AV/EDR)
- Server logs for critical services
- DNS logs (if available)
- Email security events (if available)

## Teaching activity
Ask participants:
- “If something went wrong, what evidence would you want?”
Then map that evidence to log sources.
