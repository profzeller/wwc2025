## What is a log?
A log is a record of events. Logs help you answer:

- What happened?
- When did it happen?
- Which account/device did it involve?

## Why logs matter
Without logs, incidents turn into guessing.

## High-value logs (starter list)

- Login successes and failures
- MFA events (enabled, challenged, failed)
- Endpoint security alerts
- Admin actions on key systems
- Server/service errors on important systems
