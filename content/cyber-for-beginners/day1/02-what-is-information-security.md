# What Is Information Security?

## Big idea
Information security is about **reducing risk** to information and systems by preventing problems, detecting problems, and responding well when problems happen.

## What information security is NOT

- Not just “hacking”
- Not only for large companies
- Not a product you buy once and forget

## What we are trying to protect
Examples:

- Personal data (student records, employee data)
- Money and accounts
- Systems and services (wifi, websites, email)
- Trust and reputation

## Beginner-friendly security areas
You do not need to be an expert in all of these to understand the basics:

- Identity and access (logins, permissions)
- Networks (how data moves)
- Endpoints (laptops, phones)
- Web and applications (browsers, websites)
- Data protection (backups, encryption)
- Monitoring and response (logs, incident response)

## Quick check (2 minutes)
Write one example of:

- Something worth protecting (an asset)
- Something that could go wrong
- Something you could do to reduce that risk
