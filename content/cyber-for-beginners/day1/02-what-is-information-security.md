# What Is Information Security?

![Information security fundamentals showing assets, threats, vulnerabilities, and controls](/assets/cyber-for-beginners/day1/images/day1-what-is-information-security.png)

Information security is the practice of protecting information and systems from:

- Unauthorized access
- Unauthorized use
- Unauthorized disclosure
- Disruption
- Modification
- Destruction

## Core Building Blocks

### Assets
Anything of value:

- Data (grades, credentials, research)
- Systems (servers, laptops, networks)
- Accounts and identities
- Organizational reputation

### Threats
Anything capable of causing harm:

- Malware
- Phishing and social engineering
- Insider misuse (intentional or accidental)
- Misconfigurations
- Physical loss or theft

### Vulnerabilities
Weaknesses that threats exploit:

- Weak passwords
- Unpatched software
- Excessive permissions
- Poor monitoring

### Controls
Safeguards that reduce risk:

- Technical (firewalls, MFA, encryption)
- Administrative (policies, procedures)
- Physical (locks, access badges)

## Risk Thinking
Risk is often described as:
**Likelihood × Impact**

Not all vulnerabilities are equal, and not all risks should be treated the same.

## Teaching Tip
Encourage students to understand *systems and relationships*
before introducing tools.
