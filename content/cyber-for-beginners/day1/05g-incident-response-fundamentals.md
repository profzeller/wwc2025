# Incident Response Fundamentals

## Learning objectives
- Explain the incident response lifecycle
- Teach beginners what to do first (triage and containment)
- Emphasize evidence preservation and communication

## Phases (simple)
1. Prepare
2. Detect
3. Contain
4. Eradicate
5. Recover
6. Learn (post-incident improvement)

## First actions (beginner-friendly)
- Verify what you know vs what you assume
- Preserve evidence (logs, timestamps, notes)
- Contain impact (limit spread)
- Communicate through the right channels

## Mini-scenario
A user reports suspicious MFA prompts they did not initiate.
- What do you do in the first 15 minutes?
- What evidence do you collect?
- What does “containment” look like here?
