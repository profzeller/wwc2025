# Incident Response Fundamentals

## Big idea
Incidents happen. The difference between a small problem and a disaster is how you respond.

## Simple incident response phases

1. Prepare
2. Detect
3. Contain
4. Eradicate
5. Recover
6. Learn (improve)

## First steps (beginner-friendly)
When something suspicious happens:

- Write down what you know (facts)
- Preserve evidence (logs, timestamps, screenshots if appropriate)
- Limit spread (containment)
- Communicate using the right channels

## Scenario (10 minutes)
A user reports repeated MFA prompts they did not initiate.

Answer:

- What is the most likely risk?
- What would you do in the first 15 minutes?
- What evidence would you collect?
- What would “containment” look like?
