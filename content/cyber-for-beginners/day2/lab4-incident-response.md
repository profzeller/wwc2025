# Lab 4 — Incident Response Basics  
**Incident Response Walkthrough: Roles, Evidence, and Decisions**

## Goal
Practice responding to a security incident in a **structured, calm, and documented way** instead of reacting impulsively.

This lab emphasizes:

- Clear roles
- Evidence preservation
- Deliberate decision-making
- Documentation before action

---

## Scenario
A staff member reports **unexpected MFA prompts** on their account and is concerned someone may be trying to access it.

You are part of a small security response team tasked with handling the situation correctly.

---

## Key Concepts
- Incident response phases:
- 
  - Detection
  - Containment
  - Eradication
  - Recovery
- Roles and responsibilities
- Evidence handling
- Why documentation matters early

---

## What You’ll Do
You will use a **web-based Incident Response Walkthrough** to simulate the first part of a real response.

### Step 1 — Assign Roles
In your group, assign:

- **Technical Responder** — investigates and performs approved actions
- **Decision Maker** — authorizes containment and recovery steps
- **Documentation Lead** — records timeline, actions, and current status

(No need to enter names — just agree as a group.)

---

### Step 2 — Choose Your First Actions
You have **three “first actions” tokens**, representing the first 15 minutes of response.

For each action:

- Preview what evidence it preserves
- Identify what evidence might be lost
- Decide whether the tradeoff is worth it

⚠️ Some containment actions can remove valuable evidence if taken too early.

---

### Step 3 — Review the Evidence Board
As actions are taken, evidence will be marked as:

- **Available**
- **Preserved**
- **Lost**

Use this board to:

- Assess how confident you are about what happened
- Understand the impact of your decisions

---

### Step 4 — Complete the Incident Record
Document:

- What happened (confirmed vs suspected)
- When it occurred (timeline so far)
- Actions taken in the first 15 minutes
- Current status

Your documentation should reflect what you actually know — not assumptions.

---

### Step 5 — Decide Whether to Escalate

Based on the evidence you preserved (or lost), decide:

- Do you escalate this as a likely incident?
- Do you need more information first?
- Or can it be handled as routine support?

Justify your decision clearly.

---

## Important Guardrails

- All data is synthetic
- No real systems or malware
- Focus on **process**, not speed
- Do not destroy evidence prematurely

---

## Reflection Questions
Be ready to discuss:

- Which actions felt tempting to take immediately?
- What evidence would you want before containing?
- How did lost evidence affect your confidence?
- What should happen in the **first 15 minutes** of a real incident?

---

## Getting Started
This lab runs through the **WWC Lab Hub**.

1. Start the Lab Hub
2. Launch **Lab 4 — Incident Response: Evidence Preservation Challenge**
3. Work through the steps as a team

Your instructor may pause the lab for discussion or debrief.

---

## Takeaway
Good incident response is not about panic or speed.

It is about:

- Preserving evidence
- Communicating clearly
- Documenting decisions
- Acting deliberately
