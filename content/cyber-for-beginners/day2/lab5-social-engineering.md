# Lab 5 — Social Engineering Analysis  
**Recognize, Respond, Teach**

---

## Purpose

This lab focuses on **recognizing social engineering patterns** and understanding **why they work**, without exposing students to real scams, brands, or live interactions.

Instead of memorizing examples, you will analyze **synthetic scenarios** and practice:

- Identifying manipulation techniques
- Explaining the psychological pressure being applied
- Choosing safe, responsible responses
- Thinking about how social engineering can be taught without causing harm

This lab is **analysis-only**. You will not click links, enter credentials, or interact with real systems.

## Core Concepts

- **Phishing**
- **Pretexting**
- **Vishing / Smishing**
- **Psychological levers**
  - Urgency
  - Authority
  - Fear
  - Helpfulness
- **Responsible cybersecurity education**

---

## Why This Matters

Social engineering works because it targets **human decision-making**, not technical weaknesses.

Even careful, knowledgeable people can be influenced under:

- Time pressure
- Authority claims
- Fear of consequences
- Social obligation or helpfulness

Understanding these patterns helps you:

- Protect yourself and others
- Respond calmly instead of reactively
- Teach cybersecurity concepts responsibly

---

## What You Will Do

You will be shown several **simulated communication attempts**, such as:

- Emails
- Text messages
- Phone call summaries

All scenarios are:

- Fictional
- Brand-neutral
- Designed for classroom safety

For **each scenario**, you will:

### 1. Recognize the Pattern
Identify:

- The **social engineering technique**
- The **primary psychological lever**

### 2. Deconstruct Why It Works
Explain:

- What the sender wants the target to do
- Which **decision shortcuts** are being exploited
- Why a reasonable person might comply

### 3. Choose the Safest Response
Select a response that emphasizes:

- Verification through known channels
- Reporting rather than engagement
- Calm, non-blaming behavior

### 4. Teach Responsibly
Decide how this pattern could be taught in a classroom:

- Without recreating scams
- Without shaming victims
- Without encouraging misuse

## Teaching Guardrails (Built Into the Lab)

This lab intentionally avoids:

- Real organizations or brands
- Live phishing or impersonation
- Credential entry or simulated “attacks”
- Victim-blaming language

The emphasis is on:

- Pattern recognition
- Defensive thinking
- Reporting and documentation
- Ethical instruction

---

## Success Criteria

By the end of this lab, you should be able to:

- Spot social engineering **patterns**, not just examples
- Explain **why** social engineering works
- Propose **safe and responsible responses**
- Describe how to teach these concepts **without causing harm**

This is not a quiz.  
Different answers can be reasonable if they demonstrate clear reasoning and prioritize safety.

## Launching the Lab

1. Start the **WWC 2025 Lab Hub**
2. Launch **Lab 5 — Social Engineering Analysis**
3. Complete the scenarios individually or in guided discussion

Instructors may pause between scenarios for group reflection.

---

## Reflection Questions (Optional)

- Which psychological lever did you find hardest to recognize?
- How does time pressure change decision quality?
- What makes reporting feel uncomfortable, and how can organizations reduce that friction?
- How would you explain social engineering to a non-technical audience?

**Remember:**  
Good cybersecurity is not about catching mistakes — it is about building systems and habits that support people under pressure.
