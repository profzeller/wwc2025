# Labs

## What you’ll do here
These labs are hands-on activities that go with the workshop lessons. You will launch them from the Lab Hub running on your computer.

## Start here (required)
Before any lab, complete:

[Lab Environment Setup](/workshops/cyber-for-beginners/labs/setup/)

## How labs work

1. Install prerequisites (Docker + Git)
2. Clone the labs repository
3. Start the Lab Hub
4. Launch the lab you need (Start → Launch)

## Troubleshooting
If a lab won’t launch, first verify:

- Docker is running
- The Lab Hub is up at http://localhost:8080
- You built the images using the correct profile
